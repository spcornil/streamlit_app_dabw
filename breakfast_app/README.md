# Creation of streamlit app as a part of the Snowflake App Developer's Workshop

#### App located here:
https://spcornil-streamlit--breakfast-appstreamlit-breakfast-app-vo6goo.streamlit.app/

Sources catalog from Snowflake back-end, displays nutrition info based on selection. Allows user to add additional fruits to the (snowflake) back-end.

Snowflake tables are populated via REST API calls (developed with Rivery) to FruityVice & USDA FoodData, where JSON data was ingested/transformed/loaded into flat tables.
